##Introduction to pgRouting
###FOSS4G UK
###Southampton 14 - 16 June 2016

####Introduction
This short workshop will show you how to load OS Open Roads into a PostgreSQL database and build a network to use with pgRouting – an open source routing extension to the database.  We will be using the OSGeo LIVE image which has all the software installed and configured already.

####The data
We will be using an extract of OS Open Roads (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html).  We’ll use a subset for ease of use and better performance.

####The software
PostgreSQL with the PostGIS and pgRouting extensions are available as part of the OSGeo LIVE image.  We will be interacting with the database through pgAdmin – an administration console for PostgreSQL.  Results will be visualised in QGIS and we’ll interact with our network using the pgRouting Layer plugin.
